                        call him K</em>. Right, young K was a healthy, young boy, which was surprising, considering
                        that his mother was very clearly malnourished and his father was very clearly dead.
                    </li>

                        to avoid the fate of his mother and the rest of the denizens of the small hamlet he lived in:
                        death.
                    </li>
                    <li class="custom-list"><span class="date">Year 5  </span>With his inexplicable health, K soon
                        caught the eye of the roving bands of bandits that made their living off the highway that wound
                        it's
                        way a few miles away from the hamlet. Thus began a new chapter in K's life. He was now a highway
                        robber, albeit an undersized one.
                    </li>
                    <li class="custom-list"><span class="date">Year 10 </span>Due to the general lack of knowledge about
                        concepts such as calendars and dates prevalent in those enlightened times, we can only narrow the
                        occurrence of a pivotal event in K's life down to his tenth year with any reasonable accuracy.
                        He died.
